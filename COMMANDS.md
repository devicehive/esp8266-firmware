#Overview
This document explains the set of REST API commands to control your remote ESP8266 — an incredible all around IoT chip. For more information about ESP8266 please refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266

Once ESP8266 device is connected you can issue commands using DeviceHive's REST API. It can be a JavaScript, python or anything that supports HTTP and JSON, even command-line curl.

*Example using curl on Mac or Linux:*
```shell
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer eiMfp26Z+yRhiAafXWHCXT0LofwehgikmtygI6XoXIE=' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"command":"gpio/write","parameters":{"1":0}}' \
http://nn8571.pg.devicehive.com/api/device/astaff/command
```
This would set PIN1 to 0. For expample on Adafruit's Huzzah ESP8266 modules (https://www.adafruit.com/products/2471) with PIN1 connected to LED it will turn the LED on. 

Below you can find JSON commands to interact with low-level peripherals on your chip.

#GPIO
Each ESP8266 pin can be loaded up to 12 mA. Pins also have overvoltage and reverse current protection.

##gpio/write
Sets gpio pins according to parameters specified. Pins will be automatically initialized as output when command is received. All pins will be set up simultaneously. Unlisted pins will remain unaffected.

*Parameters*:    
JSON with a set of key-value pairs, where key is pin number and value '0' for LOW, '1' for HIGH or 'x' for NOP, leaving pin unaffected. Sample below sets gpio10 to LOW and gpio11 to HGIH.

*Example*:
```json
{ 
	"command":"gpio/write",
	"parameters":
	{
		"10":"0",
		"11":"1",
		"12":"x"
	}
}
```

Returns 'OK' on success or 'Error' with description in result.

##gpio/read
Reads the state of all GPIO pins. Only pins specified in the request will be initialized as input.

*Parameters*:  
JSON with a set of key-value pairs, where key is pin number and value is one of the following: 
* "init" - in ESP8266 all pins are initialized as input by default. If pin was used as output in gpio/write or to interface with other peripherals before, pass this argument to re-init the pin before reading. Pullup state will not be affected.  
* "pullup" - init pin as input and enable pullup  
* "nopull" - init pin as input and disable pullup  

*Example*:  
```json
{ 
	"command":"gpio/read",
	"parameters":
	{
		"10":"init",
		"11":"pullup",
		"12":"nopull"
	}
}
```

Note: pull up and pull down are the SoC feature that allows to set input to high or low through resistor with very high resistance. By default each pin is not connected (Z) and reading will return random value. Enabling pull up feature puts a very weak high level on input pin by default and pull down sets very weak low level, thus making it's state determined as 1 or 0.

Returns 'OK' on success with result or 'Error' with description in result.

*Example*:  
```json
{
	"0":"0",
	"1":"1",
	"2":"0"
}
```

##gpio/int
Allows you to subscribe to notifications (interrupts) on pin state change.

*Parameters*:  
JSON with a set of key-value pairs. Where key is pin number and value is one of the following: 
* "disable" - disable notifications
* "rising" - send notification on rising edge  
* "falling" - send notification on falling edge  
* "both"  - send notification on rising and falling edge  
* "timeout" - notification will be sent only after a certain period of time. Minimum is 50 ms. Maximum is 8388607 ms. If not specified, previous timeout will be used. Default is 250 ms.  

Mnemonic "all" can be used to set value for all pins.

*Note: Timeout feature shall be used whenever is practicle to avoid flooding with notifications.*

*Example*:  
```json
{
	"all":"disable",
	"11":"rising",
	"12":"falling",
	"13":"both",
	"timeout":"100"
}
```

Returns 'OK' on success with result or 'Error' with description in result.

Notifications will be generated with the name 'gpio/int'. Each notification will contain list of gpio pins affected in 'caused' field (read: pins that caused an interrupt), 'state' contains values of all gpio inputs after timeout and 'tick' contains the number of ticks of SoC's internal clock as a timestamp:
```json
{
	"caused":["0", "1"],
	"state":{
		"0":"0",
		"1":"1"
		"16":"0"
	}
	"tick":"123456"
}
```
#ADC
ESP8266 has just one ADC channel. This channel is connected to a dedicated pin 6 - ‘TOUT’. ADC can measure voltage in range from 0.0V to 1.0V with 10 bit resolution. 

##adc/read
Reads ADC channels values. ESP8266 has just one channel - ‘0’.

*Parameters*:  
Can be empty, all channels will be sent in this case.
JSON with a set of key-value pairs, where key is pin number and value is one of the following: 
"read" - read channel current value  

*Example*:  
```json
{
	"all":"read",
	"0":"read"
}
```

Returns 'OK' on success with result or 'Error' with description in result. Each entry contains channel number and value in volts. 
```json
{
	"0":"0.6"
}
```

##adc/int
Subscribes on notifications with ADC value with some period.

*Parameters*:  
Json with set of key-value, where key is ADC channel and value is period in milliseconds or ‘disable’ for disabling. ‘0’ value also means disable. Period can be from 250 till 8388607 ms.

*Example*:  
```json
{
	"0":"1000",
	"0":"disable"
}
```

In this example value of channel 0 will be sent every 1 second.
Return ‘OK’ in status. Or ‘Error’ and description in result on error. Notification will have name 'adc/int' and following format:
```json 
{
	"0":"0.0566"
}
```
Where "0" channel number, and "0.0566" current voltage in volts.

#3. PWM
ESP8266 has only software implementation of PWM wich means there is no real-time guarantee on high frequency of PWM. PWM has just one channel, but this channel can control all GPIO outputs with different duty cycle. It also means that all outputs are synchronized and work with the same frequency. PWM depth is 100. PWM can be used as pulse generator with specified number of pulses.

##3.1 pwm/control
Enable or disable PWM.

*Parameters*:  
Json with set of key-value, where key is pin name and value is duty cycle. Duty cycle is an integer between 0..100, ie percent. Mnemonic pin ‘all’ also can be used to control all GPIO pins simultaneously. To disable PWM for one of the outputs, just set value to ‘disable’ or ‘0’. PWM can be also disabled for pin if command ‘gpio/write’ or 'gpio/read'(only with some pins for init)' is called for pin.
There are also additional parameters:   
‘frequency’ - set PWM base frequency, if this parameter was omitted, previous frequency will be used. ‘frequency’ also can be set while PWM working or before command with pins duty cycles. Default frequency is 1 kHz. Minimum frequency is 0.0005 Hz, maximum is 2000 Hz  
‘count’ - the number of pulses that PWM will generate after command, maximum is 4294967295, 0 means never stop. Pins with 100% duty cycle will be switched to low level when pwm stops.  
*Example*:  
```json
{
	"0":"50",
	"frequency":"1000",
	"count":"10000"
}
```

This example starts PWM with square pulses for 10 seconds, duty cycle is 50%, frequency 1 kHz.

Return ‘OK’ in status. Or ‘Error’ and description in result on error.

*Notes:
PWM is can be used to generate single or multiple pulses with specific length:
{ "0":"100",  "frequency":"1000", "count":"100"} - generate single pulse 100 milliseconds length
{ "0":"30",  "frequency":"0.1", "count":"4"} - generate 4 pulses 3 seconds length, 7 seconds interval between pulses.*

#4. UART

Framing can be omitted, 8N1 will be used in this case. If this parameter specified UART will be reinit with specified mode. If this parameter is omitted, port will use current settings("115200 8N1" by default) and will not reinit port.  
"data" - data string encoded with base64. Original data size have to be equal or less than 264 bytes.  
*Example*:

}
```
Return ‘OK’ in status. Or ‘Error’ and description in result on error.
##4.2 uart/int
Subscribe on notification which contains data that was read from UART. Firmware starts wait for data from and each time when byte is received byte puts into buffer (264 bytes len), then firmware starts wait for the next byte with some timeout. When timeout reached or buffer is full firmware sends notification.

*Parameters*:  
"mode" - the same "mode" parameter as in "uart/write"command, see description there. It also can be omitted to keep current parameters. Additionally this parameter can be "disable" or "0" for disabling notifications. 
"timeout" - timeout for notifications. Default is 250 ms. 

*Example*:  
```json
{
	"mode":"38400 8E2"
}
```

Return ‘OK’ in status. Or ‘Error’ and description in result on error. Notifications with name 'uart/int' will have following format:
```json

}
```

Where "data" key name is always used and value is string with base64 encoded data(264 or less bytes).
8.3 uart/terminal
