 *	\details	UART Hardware access layer for ESP8266. Can operate in two modes: DUM_PER_BYTE or DUM_PER_BUF.
 *				In DUM_PER_BYTE all writing operations with strings are allowed, but data operations are disabled.
 *				Each received byte cause dhuart_char_rcv callback. In DUM_PER_BUF all writing operations with data
 *				are allowed, but char operations are disabled. Callback dhuart_buf_rcv will be called after number
 *				of byte in buffer is greate or eqaul INTERFACES_BUF_SIZE or last byte was received later than
 *				specified timeout.
