    <h1 class="welcome-title">Welcome to <a href='https://github.com/devicehive/esp8266-firmware' target='_blank'>DeviceHive
        ESP8266
        firmware</a>!</h1>
    <div class="help-text">
        <p>This firmware allows to connect different devices to <a href='http://devicehive.com/' target='_blank'>DeviceHive</a>
            cloud service or use local tiny HTTP server with RESTful API embedded rigth into the chip. This page is
            hosted by
            that server.</p>
        <p>Plenty of different devices can be connected with this firmware. There are few digital interfaces: GPIO, PWM,
            I2C,
            SPI and onewire which can be used for connecting device with such interface to IoT cloud. There is also ADC
            converted on board of this chip, so it's possible to measure voltage of analog sensor. This firmware gives
            transparent gateway between this physical interfaces and clouds. There are also implementations for some
            popular
            devices like DS18B20, DHT22 etc. Please follow
            <a href='https://github.com/devicehive/esp8266-firmware/blob/master/DeviceHiveESP8266.md' target='_blank'>
                the documentaion</a> for details.</p>
        <p>Not only DeviceHive cloud service is supported. This firmware provides RESTful API which can be used in local
            network. Any 3rd party services can send direct HTTP requests on the chip. This endpoint is available at an
            URL like
            http://chip-device-id.local/api. It's <a href='./api' target='_blank'>here</a> for this chip. Firmware
            announce
            itself with mDNS, so device can be discovered with local domain name.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Samples of using RESTful API.</h3>
        <p>Requests can be sent from anywhere from any different services. The most simple and easy way to send such
            request is
            JavaScript. Samples below are the simple HTML pages with short JavaScript which perform HTTP requests and
            display
            human readable data. In all samples keep AccessKey field empty if it is not configured. Entered AccessKey is
            saved
            by browser. Feel free to view page sources directly from there as the examples of using it.</p>

        <h3>Upload web page to chip.</h3>
        <p>The firmware allows to upload any custom web page which replaces the main page. This page is always available
            as <a
                    href='./help.html'>help.html</a>. It's totally possible to use RESTful API from embedded JavaScript.
            This
            feature allows to build web page enabled devices. Samples above can be used as reference.</p>
        <p>There is an editor at <a href='./editor.html'>editor.html</a> page which can be user to edit page rigth in
            the web
            browser or upload from file/backup to file.</p>
