# DeviceHive ESP8266 Firmware
Special firmware for usage ESP8266 in DeviceHive clouds.

# Building
Project can be opened in Eclipse. For compiling you would need to install
toolchain. See instructions here: 
https://github.com/esp8266/esp8266-wiki/wiki/Toolchain
Actually we need just: 'Xtensa crosstool-NG' (https://github.com/jcmvbkbc/crosstool-NG) 
SDK is already in this repo.

# Firmware usage
Flash firmware (devicehive.bin firmware directory) to the device with
esp-flasher util (see esp-util project on top of the repo). You can also use any other
flasher for esp8266 (esptool - https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool for example).
Firmware should be flashed at 0x0 SPI chip address. Connect to device terminal
via serial port with esp-terminal (see esp-util project). You can also use any 
other serial port terminal with escape sequences support. PuTTY for Windows OS
( http://www.putty.org/ ) or 'screen' util under Linux for example. This
firmware has quite regular unix like terminal via UART. Autocomplete and command
history are supported.
Type' 'help' in terminal to see all aviable commands. At first you need to configure
device. Type 'configure' in terminal to run configuration util on it. Enter network
and server parameters, device will be rebooted. Now you can send command via
DeviceHive cloud to device. Please refer to ESP8266 firmware commands documentation
to find which commands are supported(see the top of this repo).

# genbin.sh
Small util to extract binary images for flashing for compiled file. Might be useful
for other projects. Usage:
genbin.sh <path to elf file> [<output directory>]
